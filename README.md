# BeautifulSoupPractice
This is an Ebay scraper tool built partially from a guide found online ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4hEAhHHykI ). Specifically, this is meant for practice in the use of BeautifulSoup, which is why a guide was used initially. In the guide by Red Eyed Coder Club, the scraper is built to take in information about products for sale on Ebay. In my (this) version of the scraper, Red Eyed Coder Club's code is modified and expanded upon to allow for information about previously sold items to be taken and copied to a csv. This project is specifically meant for practice using BeautifulSoup, and is not meant for actual use in a business environment.
